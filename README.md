#SlicerDeveloperToolsForExtensions


##What is it?

This repository contains a 3D Slicer extension that offers different tools to help developers when they create Slicer extension:
- It allows one to manually install extensions from an archive (*.zip or *.tar.gz). These archives can either be created locally when one creates their own extensions (this tools can help the developer to verify that their extension is correctly packaged). It can also be convenient to distribute your Slicer extensions on your own website, or privately.
-It also allows to directly load a scripted module while Slicer is already running.
